Your application can show the number of lives you have left on
the top right corner of the game window. In the top middle, your
application can show the level of the game that is played and on
the top leftmost corner can show the score.

Players should be trying to break all bricks on every level to get
scores as high possible and advance to the next level.

the ball.

Each level is cleared by breaking all breakable bricks – red bricks

paddle. The ball should bounce off at the same angle in the
opposite direction.

the player has no more lives left.
